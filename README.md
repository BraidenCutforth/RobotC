# Robot Project - Written in RobotC
  
  Here is code that was written throughout the Robot project undertaken in ENGR 120 at the University of Victoria. Milestones 2 and 3 are tests performed to make sure that motors and sensors were working as they were supposed to. Milestone 4 was the final milestone, and the code written there was used to complete the final task (described below) for this project.

# TASK

  The task for this project was to have a robot, built with VEX robotics parts, disable a target. The target was a black puck that stood about 6cm tall and had IR diodes emitting IR at a 20hz frequency. The robot was set with an object already attached to be placed on the puck to "disarm" it. The robot would first find the puck, orient itself to face the puck directly then proceed forward. Upon approaching the puck the robot would then drop the object on the puck "disarming" it. The robot would then locate a wall and park perpindicular to it. This occured in a 2.44m by 2.44m (8foot by 8foot) arena, and the robot started no less than 15cm(6 inches) away from a wall. The robot operated completely autonomously from the point of turning on to the point of parking.
